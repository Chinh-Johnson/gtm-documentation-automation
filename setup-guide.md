## Prerequisites

- A new tab will open with the Apps Script editor

## Step 3: Replace the Default Code
- You'll see a file called Code.gs with some default text

- Delete it completely
- Paste the GTM automation code (from the GitHub repository)
- Click the Save icon (ðŸ’¾) or press Ctrl+S (Cmd+S on Mac)
- When prompted, give your project a name like "GTM Documentation Tool"

## Step 4: Enable the Tag Manager API Service
- In the Apps Script editor, look for Services in the left sidebar
- Click the "+" (plus) icon next to Services
- This opens the "Add a service" dialog box

## Step 5: Add Tag Manager API
- In the service dialog, scroll down to find "Tag Manager API"
- Click on "Tag Manager API"
- Click the "Add" button in the bottom-right corner of the dialog
- The dialog will close and you'll see "TagManager" added under Services

## Step 6: Run and Authenticate the Script

       -> Choose your Google account
       -> Click "Advanced" (if you see a warning)
       -> Click "Go to [Your Project Name] (unsafe)"
       -> Click "Allow" to grant permissions

- Check the execution log:
       -> Look at the bottom panel for "Execution log"
       -> You should see "Execution started" followed by "Execution completed"
       -> If you see errors, check the troubleshooting section below

## Step 7: Access the GTM Reports Menu

        -> Generate GA4 Event Tag Report
        -> Configure GTM Settings

## Step 8: Configure Your GTM Settings
- Click "Configure GTM Settings" first
- A popup window will appear with instructions
- Find your GTM IDs:
       -> Open Google Tag Manager in another tab
       -> Navigate to your desired workspace
       -> Look at the URL:  https://tagmanager.google.com/#/container/accounts/12345/containers/67890/workspaces/11121314/
       -> Extract the three numbers:
            Account ID: 12345
            Container ID: 67890
            Workspace ID: 11121314
- Enter the IDs in the configuration popup
- Click "Save Configuration"

## Step 9: Generate Your Documentation
- Click "GTM Reports" in the menu again
